# Heart Disease Hospitalizations Analysis

## Project Overview

This project dives into the intricate relationships between heart disease hospitalizations and a multitude of influencing factors, including lifestyle choices and environmental exposures. By leveraging data from reputable sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), BioMed Central Ltd (BMC), and the United States Census Bureau, we provide a detailed examination of how various factors like hypertension, air quality, and smoking contribute to the prevalence of heart disease hospitalizations.

### Goal

The goal is to investigate and elucidate the multifaceted links between heart disease hospitalizations and their influencing factors, aiming to inform and guide healthcare stakeholders and the public towards effective prevention strategies.

## Audience

This analysis is tailored for a wide audience, encompassing healthcare professionals, insurance policy providers, medical researchers, educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and the general public. It seeks to educate and provide actionable insights on the prevention and management of heart disease.
